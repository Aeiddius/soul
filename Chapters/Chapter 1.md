*"The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion"*  - Albert Camus

A cold frozen breeze enveloped the dim sky. Amidst the snow, a little girl walked with heavy, painful steps. Her once humble and beautiful dress was taterred and spilled with blood. In her hands, she carried a sack of cloth dyed in the color of red.

As her weary steps landed on the ground, her body would shiver. Her barefoot numb from the coldness of snow.

The trees were dark, cold, and harrowing. Without any leaves to crown it's forgotten beauty, as if Life itself was quivered out of existence.

And the child eventually arrived at her destination.
