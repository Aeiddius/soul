# Chapter 1 - Rebirth (1)

"The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion"  - Albert Camus

War.

War is the only constantcy to mankind's illness.

For what it was worth, I fought for the freedom of my people, not for oligarchs, not for autocrats, not for corporations, and not for some meaningless flag.

I fought for my people, my family, my brothers and sisters.

So when the time came to fight for them, I took it. Fighting in the frontlines, a life of trench nightmare, rats, rot, corpses. What was it all worth?

When the enemy came, I stared straight down my barell as I watched and killed another young man who is simply fighting for the same reasons as I.

These were not enemies.

These were not invaders.

These were just kids, same as I, tricked by old men to die in a war they never wished for.

"So what do we do now?", my old friend asked me. My buddy whose been with me through it all. Lying besides me in this wet muddy trench, as his body slowly bleeds to death.

The bombs and gutshots and screams used to be loud, but I can't hear much anymore.

I desperately tried to patch him up, but no matter what I do, I couldn't block the massive hole in his stomach. Gauze after gauze, it all just kept soaking in blood.

Blood after blood after blood...

When will our suffering end?

"It's okay... that's enough...", he told me.

He held my hand firmly, and with shakiness he handed over a knife.

"Do it", he spoke with such peace. The dirt covering his and my face, I couldn't forget the smile he gave.

As if his pain would soon all disappear, all the misery and madness.

"Kill me... but if you die, pass that dagger to another", he coughed another mouthful of blood, almost drowning.

"The others will pass it on, and so on, one after another... until eventually that very dagger will reach our tyrants and slit their very throats!"

He grabbed my collar and brought me closer. His eyes showed no submission, only madness and unwillingness.

"Don't forget our mission...*cough* Our sacrifice will be forgotten. But it will not be dishonored"

And with those final words, my old friend departed this world.
